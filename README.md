# Fluid-labs
Laboratories carried out within the course of Fluid Labs at Politecnico di Milano.

## Computational Fluid Dynamics Labs
1. Laminar oil transport in a pipe
2. Turbulent water transport in a pipe \

These labs consists of simulations with PHOENICS software and analysis of the results through MATLAB.

## Experimental Labs
3. Calibration of a load cell
4. Analysis of the velocity field in the wake of a circular cylinder (experimental data from PSV)
5. Analysis of the hydrodynamic forces acting on a cylinder in steady free surface flow

For these labs, we were given experimental data, which we analyzed in MATLAB.
